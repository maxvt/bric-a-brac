Bric-a-brac

This is a collection of scripts and small programs I have developed over the years to help me solve assorted issues. Contents are organized by purpose:

- _GPS_ - navigation and GPS-related
- _Video_ - video editing, processing, encoding, and subtitle handling

Usage instructions and license information can be found in the scripts themselves.

Enjoy!
